            <div class="article">
                <p>Basketball was invented by Dr. James Naismith in 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts, USA. His goal was to create a game that would keep students active indoors during the winter. What started as a simple game with a soccer ball and a peach basket has now become one of the most popular sports in the world.</p>
                <p>Since its invention, basketball has evolved with the introduction of professional leagues like the NBA, which has helped shape the modern game we see today.</p>

                <p>Basketball is played on a rectangular court with two teams of five players each. The goal is to score points by making a shot through the hoop, which is 10 feet above the ground.
